            "description": "current vLLM scheduling method is based on FCFS, which may lead to suboptimal performance for certain workloads. To address this, I ported Longest Prefix Match (LPM) scheduling, which prioritizes requests based on the length of their matching prefixes. This approach aims to improve overall system throughput and reduce latency for specific request patterns.",
